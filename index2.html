    <h4 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">What is the Periodic Table?       </h4>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The Periodic Table of the Elements is a carefully constructed table of all the known elements in existence. It was created by Dmitri Mendeleev, who arranged the elements according to their atomic number, the number of protons each atom contains. Elements in a row have the same number of shells, whereas elements in a column have the same number of valence electrons. The elements are sorted into groups, such as halogens, metals, metalloids, and alkaline earth metals. These groups have certain shared characteristics and allow scientists to predict how elements and chemicals will behave. Studying the Periodic Table helps scientists better comprehend the complex     world of chemistry.</p>
